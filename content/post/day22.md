Today I went back to _Scala for Impatients_ for good. First thing in the morning was the kata session. I felt at the end quite disappointed, as I it went worse than yesterday. After deleting the code yesterday, I was feeling confident about the next session. But every session is a white canvas, so today, as I started my choreography, I stepped on my new ideas and fell in a loop of simple and really stupid errors. But this showed how much more quicker I have to be at asking for help on stuff that I don't know (Javascript syntax) because then I end up panicking and doing nonsense just by changing randomly  the code.  

### Traits

I find traits a really interesting part of OOP. I have the example of humans in my head in order to explain this concept:  


class justHuman{

}

class notTheAverageHuman{

}

class superHero{

}

trait superPowers{

}
