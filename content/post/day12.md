And it was about time. We are in the era of automation, in the times of CI and automated testing. I never cared about testing my code as a student and I never had to tbh.  

TDD in my head it seems like a very hard thing to do. This means -> CHALLENGE ACCEPTED  
I think that now is the ideal time to start learning TDD, as now the exercises in the book are more computational and I feel more confident writing Scala code.  After reading and researching on TDD principals, I chose ScalaTest and a simple class I wrote on Monday to work with.

* I started writing my test with Flatspec. The point was to start with the test and then write the functions in the class.

* The first test fails and this when you add functionality to your code.
