Well, this is clearly a blog...so here I am blogging :D

This is the first week of the apprenticeship, but to be honest, office already feels like home. I found my desk full of presents for my new start: a towel with the HolidayCheck logo ( I am gonna travel EVERYWHERE with it, I promise!), my precious book "The Software Craftsman" (aka Crafter, in my case), my laptop already set up <3 and other presents for my everyday life in the company. The most important --> A huge smile on everybody's face and a big loud welcome!

I have to admit that I don't remember not even half of the names I heard but I never forget faces :[=]
Anyway, the onboarding was smooth; the environment is super "learning-friendly". At some points I felt exposed to more information that I could handle buuuuut it is all very very structured and I can get back to thit anytime it's needed.
